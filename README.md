🎰 Slot Machine Game (Java Console App)

Welcome to Slot Machine Game, a simple yet fun console-based Java project built entirely from scratch by onlyzaki. 🎉

This game simulates a mini slot machine experience where players can place bets, spin the reels, and either win big or lose it all. The mechanics are designed to balance chance and strategy while keeping the gameplay engaging.

The app is a work in progress, and that’s the exciting part — it’s a project meant to grow and improve with the help of the community! 💡

🕹️ Features

Starting Cash 💵: Players begin with $100 in their wallet.

Betting System 🎯:

Bets under $10 → only the middle line counts (x3 multiplier).

Bets between $10 and $50 → multiple lines count (higher payout).

Bets of $50 or more → all lines + diagonals count (jackpot mode 💎).

Randomized Slot Reels 🎰: Uses Java’s Random class to simulate real spins.

Replay Option 🔁: Keep playing until your wallet is empty.

Input Validation ✅: Prevents invalid or impossible bets.

Console-Based Design 🖥️: Lightweight and fast — just run it and play.

🚀 Why I Built This

I, created this game as a fun way to practice Java fundamentals like:

Loops (do-while, if-else)

User input handling with Scanner

Random number generation

Exception handling

Data structures like HashMap

But more than just learning, I wanted this project to be collaborative. It’s a simple foundation that can grow into something much bigger with the creativity of the community.

💡 Ideas for Improvement

This project is far from complete, and that’s where you come in! Here are some things we can add together:

🎨 Better Graphics → Maybe move from console text to a GUI (Swing, JavaFX).

🎶 Sound Effects & Animations → Make it feel more like a real slot machine.

💾 Save/Load System → Track player progress across sessions.

🏆 Leaderboard → Compete with friends for the highest winnings.

⚡ Cleaner Code Structure → Refactor into multiple classes (e.g., Game, Player, SlotMachine).

🌍 Multiplayer Support → Play with others online or on the same machine.
